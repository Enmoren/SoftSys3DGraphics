## 3DGraphics
#### Authors: Enmo Ren, Cassandra Overney, Hwei-Shin Harriman

For this project, we will be implementing data visualization using OpenGL. Our MVP is to create an interactive 3D plot with perspective rendering using OpenGL. We are thinking of visualizing a simple Gaussian distribution. Our medium range goal is to render a volumetric dataset in OpenGL. One possible [dataset](https://code.google.com/archive/p/gpumcml/) for this goal is a Monte Carlo simulation of light transport in biological tissue (also known as MCML). Our stretch goal is to implement AR-based data visualization by overlaying 3D data on real-world objects and scenes. Another stretch goal is to potentially apply an AR-based data visualization on mobile devices via an Android app.
##### Our collective learning goals include:
- Improve our C programming skills
- Learn some C++
- Gain exposure in computer graphics, especially in terms of using the OpenGL library
##### Our individual learning goals include:
- **Cassandra**: I want to learn about how linear algebra connects to graphics with all of the coordinate transformations. I have never done any graphics projects, and it would be nice to gain exposure into that field via OpenGL. I am also really interested in the 3D interactive components of our project. I enjoyed creating 2D interactive data visualizations for Software Design and want to expand my interactive data visualization skills to the next level. Connecting OpenGL 3D visualizations with a mobile app would be a dream come true!
- **Enmo**: I would like to learn some fundamental computer graphics concepts by utilizing OpenGL. And I am also interested in creating 3D visualizations of datasets and potentially incorporating interactive components such as keyboard input and motion sensor input. Meanwhile, I would like to gain experience writing code in C++.
- **Hwei-Shin**: Since I have been involved with SIGGRAPH for a few years, I am very excited to be learning a bit about computer graphics. I am also really interested in using OpenGL to create 3D visualizations of a dataset, since this is the perfect intersection between linear algebra, data visualization, and computer science. I’m also excited to gain some more experience with OpenCV, since our final SoftDes project involved some of its functionality. Overall, I am very enthusiastic about all aspects of this project and can’t wait to see how much we can learn over the next 5 weeks.


We found a wonderful [OpenGL cookbook](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/opengl-data-visualization/9781782169727/), which contains a few tutorials on installing OpenGL, creating 2D and 3D visualizations, and combining these visualizations with mobile apps. Some of us have already downloaded the software and got the first tutorial to work, which was a multi colored rotating triangle.

##### Our next three concrete tasks are:
1. **Hwei-Shin**: Download OpenGL and finish chapter 1 of the OpenGL cookbook
2. **Cassandra**: Go through chapter 2 of the OpenGL cookbook
3. **Enmo**: Complete tutorial 1 from the OpenGL cookbook
4. **Everyone**: Go through chapter 3 of the OpenGL cookbook
5. **Whoever finishes first**: Look through the Python OpenGL resource
